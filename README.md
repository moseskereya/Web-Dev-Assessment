Walkthrough Explanation

    Identify the Table: The script starts by identifying the table containing the results using document.querySelector('table'). If no table is found, it logs an error and returns an empty array.

    Extract Headers: The script extracts the headers from the first row of the table using querySelectorAll('th'), and maps them into an array of header names.

    Extract Data Rows: The script then processes each data row, skipping the header row. It creates an object for each student by mapping table cell values to the corresponding headers.

    Return Results: The script returns an array of these objects, representing the student results.

Challenges

    HTML Structure Variability: The primary challenge was ensuring the script works regardless of potential changes in the HTML structure. Using querySelector and querySelectorAll ensures flexibility by targeting elements directly.

    Error Handling: To improve robustness, I added checks for the presence of the table and data rows to handle cases where the expected HTML structure might be missing.

    Data Sanitization: Trimming whitespace from header and cell values ensures the resulting data is clean and consistent.

Improvements

    Dynamic Header Mapping: If the header names in the table are dynamic, additional logic could be added to map them to a standardized set of keys.
    Error Messages: Enhance error messages for better debugging in more complex scenarios.
    

By following this process, you can dynamically extract and format the data from the results page. This script can be modified further to suit different data structures or additional processing needs.
